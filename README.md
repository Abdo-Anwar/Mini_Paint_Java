**Mini Paint App** is a lightweight desktop application built using **Java** and **Java Swing**. It allows users to create, modify, and manage geometric shapes such as circles, rectangles, squares, and line segments. The app supports features like drawing, coloring, moving, resizing, saving, and loading shapes. This project was developed as part of the **Programming II** course at Alexandria University, Faculty of Engineering.

## Introduction
The **Mini Paint App** is a simplified painting application that allows users to:
- Draw geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, squares, and line segments).
- Colorize and fill shapes.
- Move and resize shapes.
- Save and load shapes to/from a file.
- Manage shapes using a user-friendly GUI.

This project was developed in two phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Basic drawing and shape management .
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced functionality with moving, resizing, saving, and loading shapes.

## Features
### Phase 1 Features:
- **Drawing Tools**: Draw circles, rectangles, squares, and line segments.
- **Color Picker**: Choose colors for shapes and their fill.
- **Shape Management**: Add, remove, and list shapes using a drop-down menu.
- **Undo/Redo**: Easily undo or redo actions.

### Phase 2 Features:
- **Move Shapes**: Move shapes to new positions.
- **Resize Shapes**: Adjust the dimensions of shapes.
- **Save/Load**: Save shapes to a file and load them later.
- **Enhanced GUI**: Intuitive interface for managing shapes and operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Java AWT**: For basic rendering and event handling.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **UML Diagrams**: For system design and documentation.
